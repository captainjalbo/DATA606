Statistics and Probability work

1. Basics of Statistics: Understanding of principles, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and position measures (quartiles, percentiles, z-scores).

2. Probabilistic concepts: Understanding of probability basics, including combinations and permutations, probability laws/rules, conditional probability, and dependency. 

3. Probability distributions: Ability to recognize and analyze different types of distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal, etc.).

4. Hypothesis Testing: Understanding the process for testing hypotheses, using techniques such as Z-test, T-test, Chi-squared test, and ANOVA.

5. Regression Analysis: Understanding the principles of regression, interpreting outputs of regression analysis, and understanding the concept of correlation.

6. Statistical modeling: Includes model selection, diagnosis, and result interpretation.

R plays a heavy role in these processes given its statistical processing capabilities.
